*Some Key Features*

- Filleted fan duct and large exhaust ports for optimized air cooling. 
- Large pocket for NVME devices in bottom half, can accomodate permanent heatsinks such as those on "Crucial T705"
- Small Vent holes for nvme venting as well, fan drives cooling as the entire internal cavity acts as a plenum (see below)

*Assembly Instructions*

3d print: Select the upper and lower half files that meet your needs, then print. After printing, insert ruthex M3 threaded inserts (this model was made for these: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BCRZZS3?ref_=ppx_hzod_title_dt_b_fed_asin_title_0_3&th=1) in the top half's screw holes. 
CNC Machining: Offset the screwholes on the top half down to a total diameter of ~2.6mm, hand tap. Assemble as instructed above in "3d print".
