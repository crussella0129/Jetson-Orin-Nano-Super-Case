Version with GPIO Cutout Top Half and Vented Bottom Half

Some Key Features: 
- Filleted fan duct and large exhaust ports for optimized air cooling. 
- Large pocket for NVME devices in bottom half, can accomodate permanent heatsinks such as those on "Crucial T705"
- Small Vent holes for nvme venting as well, fan drives cooling as the entire internal cavity acts as a plenum (specifically with the Case_V1.2_LHalf_Vented)
